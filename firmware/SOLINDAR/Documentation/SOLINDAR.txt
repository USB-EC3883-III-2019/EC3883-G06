Module "AS1"       (component AsynchroSerial)
   - AS1_RecvChar -If any data is received, this method returns one character, otherwise it returns an error code (it does not 
                wait for data). This method is enabled only if the receiver property is enabled.  [Note:] Because the preferred 
                method to handle error and break exception in the interrupt mode is to use events <OnError> and <OnBreak> the 
                return value ERR_RXEMPTY has higher priority than other error codes. As a consequence the information about an 
                exception in interrupt mode is returned only if there is a valid character ready to be read.
   - AS1_SendChar -Sends one character to the channel. If the component is temporarily disabled (Disable method) SendChar 
                method only stores data into an output buffer. In case of a zero output buffer size, only one character can be 
                stored. Enabling the component (Enable method) starts the transmission of the stored data. This method is 
                available only if the transmitter property is enabled.
   - AS1_SendBlock -Sends a block of characters to the channel.  This method is available only if non-zero length of the output 
                buffer is defined and the transmitter property is enabled.
   - AS1_ClearTxBuf -Clears the transmit buffer.  This method is available only if non-zero length of the output buffer is 
                defined and the receiver property is enabled.
   - AS1_GetCharsInRxBuf -Returns the number of characters in the input buffer. This method is available only if the receiver 
                property is enabled.
   - AS1_GetCharsInTxBuf -Returns the number of characters in the output buffer. This method is available only if the 
                transmitter property is enabled.

Module "TI1"       (component TimerInt)

Module "AD1"       (component ADC)
   - AD1_Measure -This method performs one measurement on all channels that are set in the component inspector. (Note: If the 
                <number of conversions> is more than one the conversion of A/D channels is performed specified number of times.)
   - AD1_MeasureChan -This method performs measurement on one channel. (Note: If the <number of conversions> is more than one 
                the conversion of the A/D channel is performed specified number of times.)
   - AD1_GetChanValue -Returns the last measured value of the required channel. Format and width of the value is a native 
                format of the A/D converter.
   - AD1_GetValue16 -This method returns the last measured values of all channels. Compared with <GetValue> method this method 
                returns more accurate result if the <number of conversions> is greater than 1 and <AD resolution> is less than 
                16 bits. In addition, the user code dependency on <AD resolution> is eliminated.

Module "Cap1"      (component Capture)
   - Cap1_Enable -This method enables the component - it starts the capture. Events may be generated 
                (<DisableEvent>/<EnableEvent>).
   - Cap1_Disable -This method disables the component - it stops the capture. No events will be generated.
   - Cap1_Reset -This method resets the counter register (see implementation note in <General Info>).
   - Cap1_GetCaptureValue -This method gets the last value captured by enabled timer (see implementation note in <General Info>)
                . The method does not return valid value after initialization or after <Reset> until new capture event (even if 
                the returned Error code is ERR_OK).
   - Cap1_GetPinValue -The method reads the Capture pin value. The method is available only if it is possible to read the pin 
                value (usually not available for internal signals).

Module "Bits1"     (component BitsIO)
   - Bits1_GetDir -Return selected direction.
   - Bits1_GetVal -Returns the value of the Input/Output component. If the direction is [input] then reads the input value of 
                the pins and returns it. If the direction is [output] then returns the last written value (see <Safe mode> 
                property for limitations).
   - Bits1_PutVal -Specified value is passed to the Input/Output component. If the direction is [input] saves the value to a 
                memory or a register, this value will be written to the pins after switching to the output mode - using 
                [SetDir(TRUE)] (see <Safe mode> property for limitations). If the direction is [output] it writes the value to 
                the pins. (Method is available only if the Direction = _[output]_ or _[input/output]_).
   - Bits1_GetBit -Returns the value of the specified bit/pin of the Input/Output component. If the direction is [input] then 
                it reads the input value of the pin and returns it. If the direction is [output] then it returns the last 
                written value (see <Safe mode> property for limitations).
   - Bits1_PutBit -Specified value is passed to the specified bit/pin of the Input/Output component. If the direction is 
                [input] it saves the value to a memory or register, this value will be written to the pin after switching to 
                the output mode - using [SetDir(TRUE)] (see <Safe mode> property for limitations). If the direction is [output] 
                it writes the value to the pin. (Method is available only if the Direction = _[output]_ or _[input/output]_).
   - Bits1_SetBit -Sets (to one) the specified bit of the Input/Output component. It is the same as [PutBit(Bit, TRUE)]. 
                (Method is available only if the Direction = _[output]_ or _[input/output]_).
   - Bits1_ClrBit -Clears (sets to zero) the specified bit of the Input/Output component. It is the same as [PutBit(Bit, FALSE)
                ]. (Method is available only if the Direction = _[output]_ or _[input/output]_).
   - Bits1_NegBit -Negates (inverts) the specified bit of the Input/Output component. It is the same as [PutBit(Bit,!GetBit(Bit)
                )]. (Method is available only if the Direction = _[output]_ or _[input/output]_).

Module "TI2"       (component TimerInt)

Module "Bit1"      (component BitIO)
   - Bit1_SetDir -Sets a pin direction (available only if the direction = _[input/output]_).
   - Bit1_GetVal -Returns the input/output value. If the direction is [input] then the input value of the pin is read and 
                returned. If the direction is [output] then the last written value is returned (see <Safe mode> property for 
                limitations). This method cannot be disabled if direction is [input].
   - Bit1_PutVal -The specified output value is set. If the direction is [input], the component saves the value to a memory or 
                a register and this value will be written to the pin after switching to the output mode (using [SetDir(TRUE)]; 
                see <Safe mode> property for limitations). If the direction is [output], it writes the value to the pin. 
                (Method is available only if the direction = _[output]_ or _[input/output]_).
   - Bit1_ClrVal -Clears (set to zero) the output value. It is equivalent to the [PutVal(FALSE)]. This method is available only 
                if the direction = _[output]_ or _[input/output]_.
   - Bit1_SetVal -Sets (to one) the output value. It is equivalent to the [PutVal(TRUE)]. This method is available only if the 
                direction = _[output]_ or _[input/output]_.

   - FC321_GetTimeUS -This method returns the time (as a 16-bit unsigned integer) in microseconds since the last resetting 
                after the last reset.
   - FC321_GetTimeMS -This method returns the time (as a 16-bit unsigned integer) in milliseconds since the last resetting 
                after the last reset.

Module "Bit2"      (component BitIO)
   - Bit2_GetVal -Returns the input/output value. If the direction is [input] then the input value of the pin is read and 
                returned. If the direction is [output] then the last written value is returned (see <Safe mode> property for 
                limitations). This method cannot be disabled if direction is [input].
